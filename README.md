General Information

I have created a prototype that is a remixed R&B composition in both Pacific island-Siren and Middle Eastern Dabke styles. 


What problem does it (intend to) solve?

This prototype aims to tackle the underrepresentation of both the Pacific Island and Middle Eastern community in the artistic/musical lanscape.


What is the purpose of your project?

My project intends to be a means of intersectional representation and community representation.


Why did you undertake it?

Positive and accurate means of representation for both the Pasifika and Arab community are important for me as I am a biracial member of both communities.
